# CODEOWNERS - GitOps Repository Ownership
# Story 1.4: Implement GitOps Pull Request Approval Workflow
#
# This file defines code ownership for automatic review assignment.
# When a PR is created, GitHub automatically assigns reviewers based on these rules.
#
# Syntax: <path-pattern> <owner1> <owner2> ...
# Multiple owners can be specified (at least one approval required)

# Global ownership - platform team owns all infrastructure
* @mokhahmed92

# Platform core components (Spark, Volcano, Airflow)
# Requires platform team approval for any changes
/platform-core/ @mokhahmed92

# Bootstrap resources (ArgoCD installation and configuration)
# Critical infrastructure - requires senior platform engineer approval
/bootstrap/ @mokhahmed92

# Observability components (Splunk, New Relic)
# Requires platform team and observability team approval
/observability/ @mokhahmed92

# Multi-tenant namespace definitions
# Requires platform team and security review
/namespaces/ @mokhahmed92

# CI/CD workflows - require DevOps approval
/.github/workflows/ @mokhahmed92

# Documentation - requires technical writer review (optional)
/docs/ @mokhahmed92

# Production Note:
# Replace @mokhahmed92 with appropriate team handles when deploying:
# - @platform-team (for general platform changes)
# - @senior-platform-engineers (for bootstrap changes)
# - @observability-team (for monitoring/logging)
# - @security-team (for namespace isolation and RBAC)
